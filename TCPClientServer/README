COURSE: CIS3210             ASSIGNMENT: 1 - TCP CLIENT/SERVER FOR FILE TRANSFER
DATE: October 5, 2017
____________________________________________________________________________________________
COMPILING THE PROGRAM

In order to get this program, navigate to the ChanceCantwellA1 directory (not in bin, src, or include)
and type "make" at command prompt [without quotes].  If there are any .o files located in the directory,
they can be removed by typing "make clean" at the command prompt [without quotes]. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________
OPERATING THE PROGRAM

In order to start the components of the assignment, type the following commands without quotes at the command prompt
after the compiling step:
Client: "bin/client <yourhostname>:<yourportnumber> <yourfilename> <yourbuffersize>"
Server: "bin/server <yourportnumber>"
You can replace <yourhostname>, <yourportnumber>, <yourfilename> and <yourbuffer> with whatever you decide.  For example,
for a host name of "percy.socs.uoguelph.ca", port number of 12008, filename of "testing.txt", and buffer size of 500,
the commands entered into the command prompt for client and server would look like the following:

bin/client percy.socs.uoguelph.ca:12008 testing.txt 500
bin/server 12008

If a buffer size is not provided, the client program will use a default buffer size of 500 bytes.

A script has been provided in the ChanceCantwellA1 directory called runLocalhost.sh.  This may be used to
run a series of 10 client programs using "localhost" as hostname, 12008 as port number, "testing.txt" as filename,
and 500 as buffer size.  This script can be run by typing "./runLocalhost.sh" at the command prompt [without quotes] 
instead of the client command.  If an error message is displayed, the permissions for the script execution can be set
by typing "chmod +x runLocalhost.sh" at the command prompt [without quotes].

The components of this assignment are a TCP client and a TCP server program.  The client sends the contents of a text 
file to the server where it is printed to standard output.  The client receives the same contents back from the server 
and prints them to standard output as well.  At the end of the operation, the client prints to standard output the
total number of bytes received, as well as the total amount of time the process took to execute.
____________________________________________________________________________________________
ANY LIMITATIONS?

Running the runLocalhost.sh script causes the client program to exit with a "Segmentation Fault" error.  This has been documented
in src/TCPclient.c.  Other than that, client and server programs has been tested to ensure that it works as expected.
